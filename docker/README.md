# Docker scripts

The scripts in this directory leverage Docker containers to automate a number of
development tasks for libzbxpgsql:

 * test libzbxpgsql on all supported PostgreSQL versions
 * package libzbxpgsql for all support Linux distributions

You will need a Docker engine running to make use of any of these tools.

See each the comments in each scripts' header for further details.
